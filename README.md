# HealthManager
This was a group project where we developed an android App which helps users to keep track of calories they are consuming daily. This app will calculate the users BMI and give them calorie target which they have to consume in order to maintain their weight. The app will also suggest the users what to eat based on the calorie count as well as inform them which food item contains how much calorie count. We used android sensors to keep track of userâ€™s daily exercise.

Requirement for calculating daily exercise: The device should have android sensors in it.In case, users device dont have android sensors, then, we have also used fitbit api to get the daily exercise. Therefore, if the user have fitbit watch, then our app gets the users daily exercise directly from fitbit api.
